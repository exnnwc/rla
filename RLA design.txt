Real Life Achievements

user
There are two types of achievements:
-Documented - user provides some kind of proof of its completion (should allow for proof to be made but not necessarily posted  
    in the case of sensitive material)
-Non-Documented - lower quality achievement that will have less of an impact

Achievements can be censored so that no one or only certain other users can view them. 

When creating empty achievements, there still needs to be a publication stage to activate them.

Categories aren't nearly as important.
Achievement
You did it.

Knowledge
You learned it. 

Record
Sometimes, the recording of you doing something is more important than what you actually did. #swag
