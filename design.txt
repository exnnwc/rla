Publication 
The cost to vote up an achievement is twice of whatever the achievement is currently worth. So if an achievement is worth 1, it costs 2 points to vote it up. If the achievement is worth 4 points, it should cost 8 points to vote it up and so on. Instead of the twice of what its worth, it costs an equal amount of points to vote it down. That may change depending how that works.

Documentation Process
Once a user has posted their link to documentation and marked it as completed:
    If it is the first of its kind:
        Any user can vote on it.
    If it is a previously published achievement:
        The original publisher and other users who have completed it can vote on it. (The original publisher receives 2 votes instead of 1.) 
  
Once all eligible voters have voted, the vote ends.

If no one votes and time runs out, it succeeds. 

FEATURES FOR CONSIDERATION
Should users be able to see what other users are currently working on?
Yes. Possibly, they could give someone points because they like that they're working on an achievement.

For example, one user can tag another user's achievement as something and another person can upvote that tagging action, letting the tagger receive a point. If they vote it down, the action receives a negative balance and the tagger will not receive any points from any upvotes until it becomes positive.
