#RLA 
This is a project I'm working on called Real Life Achievements. RLA is the working title. As the title implies, I' basically trying to implement video game achievements in real life.

I'm trying to avoid any kind of overt gamification like some of the other implementations where they literally try to make the achievements process like a video game. I want it to be more like social media. Kind of like how Instagram is a place where you can represent yourself in the most egoticistically fulfilling fashion with pictures. This continues that process. To basically brag about all the stuff that you've accomplished. 


One of the most important features that I would like to develop for RLA is to be able to track the progress of a particular achievement. That is paramount, especially in larger achievements that may take years. Being able to track your progress helps to not become disheartened.
