#RLA 
This is a project I'm working on called Real Life Achievements. RLA is the working title. As the title implies, I' basically trying to implement video game achievements in real life.

I'm trying to avoid any kind of overt gamification like some of the other implementations where they literally try to make the achievements process like a video game. I want it to be more like social media. Kind of like how Instagram is a place where you can represent yourself in the most egoticistically fulfilling fashion with pictures. This continues that process. To basically brag about all the stuff that you've accomplished.
